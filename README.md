## ⚙️ Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later  
- CMake  
- dlib  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy and SciPy  

## 📦 Installation
Run the following commands in order:

```bash
pip install --upgrade numpy scipy
pip install cmake
pip install dlib
pip install git+https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition
pip install opencv-python
```

## ⚠️ Note for Windows Users
The **face_recognition** and **dlib** libraries rely on C++ build tools that are not well maintained for the latest Windows versions.  
This can lead to build or compatibility issues during installation.  

also added the folder so its easier to add images and recognize

👉 It is **recommended to use Linux (e.g., Ubuntu)** for smoother setup and better compatibility with the required C++ libraries.
